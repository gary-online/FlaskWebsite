Thank you for finding you way to this readme in my repository! I'm glad you are here.

I'm a developer by hobby, and this is my first attempt at creating a webapp. I have made this all own my own and am very proud of it. 
Development, writing code, programming, and configuring custom computer operating systems have always been my hobby ever since I was a kid.
It has always been my dream to become a full-stack developer so I can build my own solutions to complex problems;
maybe even become a developer for Computershare!

Please use this code as a template to build your own Python web application with Flask! I would be honored if you used my code. If you do, please share with me what you create!

Please star this repository! It helps increase my prescense on GitHub. Thank you for reading :)

Made with ‚ù§,
Gary
