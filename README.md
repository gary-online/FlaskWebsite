# My first webapplication
## Python3 with Flask framework

### This application can only be ran on your *local computer*. 
### Please message me on LinkedIn if you would like me to show you how to run it!

Thank you for finding you way to this readme in my repository! I'm glad you are here.

I'm a developer by hobby, and this is my first attempt at creating a webapp. I have made this all own my own and am very proud of it. 
Development, writing code, programming, and configuring custom computer operating systems have always been my hobby ever since I was a kid.
It has always been my dream to become a full-stack developer so I can build my own solutions to complex problems;
maybe even become a developer for Computershare!

If you have made it this far into the readme file, thank you for your support in my dreams. I have a bachelors and masters degree in Accounting and Finance,
with no formal college computer science education.

I am fully self-taught and driven by passion.

Please star this repository! It helps increase my prescense on GitHub. Thank you for reading :)

Made with ‚ù§,
Gary
